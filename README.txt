Exercise description:
In the exercise we have built a Complex number class,
And two data structures that hold and manage the complex numbers.
We used operator overloading for a several operators for each class.

--------------------------------
File list:

- ZiData.h                Struct of two numbers that and constructor.
			  one number for the real part and the other for the imaginary.
                          

- Zi.h/.cpp -             Build manage and control the Complex number.

- array.h/.cpp -          Build manage and control the Array data struct.

- Vector.h/.cpp -         Build manage and control the Vector data struct.


      
--------------------------------
Data structures:
vector of Zi -            holds Zi objects.

Array of Zi -             holds Zi objects.
--------------------------------
Algorithms:
			  None.


--------------------------------
Known bugs:
 			  None.
